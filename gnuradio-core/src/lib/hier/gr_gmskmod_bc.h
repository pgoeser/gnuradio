 * \param samples_per_sym Samples per symbol.
 * \param bt The 3 dB time-bandwidth product.
 * \param L The length of the phase duration in symbols. The Gaussian pulse is truncated
 *          after L symbols.
 *
 * The input of this block are symbols from an M-ary alphabet
 * +/-1, +/-3, ..., +/-(M-1). Usually, M = 2 and therefore, the
 * valid inputs are +/-1.
 * The modulator will silently accept any other inputs, though.
 * The output is the phase-modulated signal.
